# PPM-HTTP

HTTP-based interface and extension for the core `PPM` project.

## Project Overview  
This repository provides a web-facing interface built on top of the `PPM` core
project. It extends the original codebase by exposing functionality through
HTTP endpoints and additional client-side components.

## Technologies  
- JavaScript  
- TypeScript  
- HTML  
- CSS
- Ionic

## Project Structure  
The project includes HTTP-related logic, client-side scripts, and additional
resources that interact with the core `PPM` project.

## Notes  
This repository depends conceptually on the `PPM` project and is intended as an
extension or demonstration of how the core functionality can be exposed via
HTTP.
